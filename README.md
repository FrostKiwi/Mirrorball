A combination of Video and WebApp ( https://mirrorball.frost.kiwi ). While watching, viewers can directly interact with examples and visualizations, on a second device or a separate browser tab.
The audience will be taken on a journey through the history and maths on the topic of the "Mirrorball projection".

Deceptively simple, it is an incredible intersection of Computer Science and Mathematics. This project has been made in conjuction with a paper in pre-print, which you can read on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10991 . The paper was submitted to [IJAT](https://www.fujipress.jp/ijat/).

## Features:
| Discover the Mirror Ball Projection with colorful visualizations | Export to Equirectangular / Lat-Long and play around with rotations |

View the projection of a Mirrorball with different colorful visualizations to understand how the math works. You can project a:
 * photo
 * video
 * live webcam stream
 * capture card feed

Any format, which your web browser can decode is supported. That should cover all important file types. You can also export as a Equirectangular projection for use in other panorama software.

## Photo contribution guide, as per [announcement](https://youtu.be/rJPKTCdk-WI?t=1822)
As shown in the sample Pull Request https://github.com/FrostKiwi/Mirrorball/pull/13, just commit the photo into any spot and mention how you want to be credited. To do so, you will need to fork this repo in the top right corner first. Then you can drag&drop the photo into the code. This will make GitHub officially credit you as contributor. I will move it to the correct folder ([Example commit](https://github.com/FrostKiwi/Mirrorball/commit/fc696841a197b9f00680e48aa3a2fbd5eec38d4b)), crop, rotate the image and credit the author ([Example Commit](https://github.com/FrostKiwi/Mirrorball/commit/425070687f39233e1583a73c37c2872e4ef9cbee)) and generate the thumbnail ([Example commit](https://github.com/FrostKiwi/Mirrorball/commit/e66261f7d8b7e00373bb9fd14e14ae6c9e90fc53)).

If that's too troublesome: Just message me on any Social media or E-Mail me at mirrorball@frost.kiwi.

## Build instructions
If you want to run the code locally:
 * Clone the repo
 * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
 * Run `npm install` in the repo's root directory to install the dependencies as defined by the [package.json](https://github.com/FrostKiwi/Mirrorball/blob/main/package.json) file
 * Run `npx vite`, so [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) will start a local server to test the code on
