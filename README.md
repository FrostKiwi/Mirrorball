A combination of Video and WebApp ( https://mirrorball.frost.kiwi ). While watching, viewers can directly interact with examples and visualizations, on a second device or a separate browser tab.
The audience will be taken on a journey through the history and maths on the topic of the "Mirrorball projection".

Deceptively simple, it is an incredible intersection of Computer Science and Mathematics.
